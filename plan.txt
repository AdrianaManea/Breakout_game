1. Create canvas context - x
2. Create and draw ball - x
3. Create and draw paddle - x
4. Create bricks - x
 - create an array within an array because we have rows of columns of bricks
 - arrays, forEach loops so we can loop through and do what we need with each brick
 - each brick will have some properties
  - like visible - for when we hit it with the ball we want it to disappear
5. Draw score - x
 - if we break a score is going to increase by 1
 - braw text onto a canvas
6. Add update() - x
- Animate 
  - redraw the canvas. And when we redraw we might have the paddle in a diffent position or different bricks broken
- we can do this with a function - requestAnimationFrame(cb) 
7. Move paddle - x
 - when we start the animation the first thing we want to do is move the paddle
 - and we're going to do that by using keyboard events
8. Keyboard event handlers to move paddle - x
9. Move ball - x
 - once we're going to be able to move the paddle we want to be able to move the ball
 - the most in depth part of this project
  - including adding boundaries
10. Add wall bounderies - x
 - if it hits the side of the canvas it needs to bounce back instead of going of the screen
11. Increase score when bricks break - x
12. Lose - x
- when we lose - redraw bricks, reset score
